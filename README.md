### 🧑‍💼 About Me

I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast, currently working as a **Software Engineer I** at **JPMorgan Chase & Co.** I’m passionate about building scalable backend systems, automating workflows, and creating clean, user-centric software using technologies like **Python**, **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **AWS**.

I actively create and share content on my **YouTube channel [@the_qubits](https://www.youtube.com/@the_qubits)** where I break down complex tech topics into beginner-friendly visuals.
